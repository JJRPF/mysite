            The sky is a beautiful shade of blue on a clear day. It stretches out as far as the eye can see and seems to go on forever. The clouds that float by are like fluffy white pillows that change shape as they move across the sky. Sometimes they form into recognizable shapes like animals or faces, and other times they are just abstract blobs. The sun shines down from above, casting its warm glow on everything below. Its a sight to behold and one that never gets old.
